<h2>Script</h2>
<pre>
(Lights rise. The Judge strikes the gavel.)

JUDGE:
(bangs gavel)
Court is now in session in the matter of State of Florida v. Johnson.
We are here for sentencing. Proceed.

PROSECUTOR:
Your Honor, Mr. Johnson stole $85 worth of groceries three months after 
completing a previous sentence for petit theft.
Under the Prison Releasee Reoffender Act, the State seeks the mandatory 
maximum sentence: five years in prison.

PUBLIC DEFENDER:
(rising quickly)
Your Honor, my client was desperate.
He stole food to survive — not for profit.
He has completed job training and we have an offer letter ready.

PROSECUTOR:
(interrupting)
The statute is clear. Mandatory maximum sentence. No exceptions.

DEFENDANT:
(pleading)
Please, Your Honor… I've turned my life around.
If I go back in, I lose the job, the progress — everything.

JUDGE:
(heavy pause)
I understand. The law fails those trying to reintegrate.
But under Florida’s PRR statute… my hands are tied.
The law requires me to impose five years.

PUBLIC DEFENDER:
So he’s returning to prison because he couldn’t get a job… 
because he was in prison. The cycle continues.

JUDGE:
(sighs)
Sometimes the law’s “toughness” just creates more crime.

(Bang—gavel falls.)

JUDGE:
Court is adjourned.
